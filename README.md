### Second Web Programming Assignment  (Web Basic Calculator)

This basic-static HTML web calculator was developed using HTML, CSS, and JS as part of my second web programming appointment. To see the webpage running, you should click [here](https://calculatorwebpage-assignment-2.herokuapp.com/) to see a previsualization.

### Disclaimer ⚠
This project is deployed using [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and PHP. Why? Foremost, Heroku has a free-not-cost deployment of at least 5 personal projects, so it’s useful for this kind of assignment. However, Heroku does not permit the deployment of static web pages using HTML, so using the following PHP snippet of code ```<?php include_once("index.html");?>``` in an ```index.php``` to include it the corresponding HTML file.
